# Project-MyCart
 MyCart is a simple e-commerce website that allows users to browse and purchase products online. This repository contains the source code and assets for the MyCart website. The website is built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Django(Python) framework for backend purpose. It currently uses the SQLite database to store product information and user data. The website features a responsive design, making it accessible on a wide range of devices. It is my first sample Project.
